welcome to the tortillalandAPI. This API was entarely made by me as a project to practice fastAPI :). During these days i have learned a lot and face some problems here and there. of course, this is only the very first version of the API itself, there still need more information and probably some corrections in the info. before continuing here are some questions that you could (or not) have!:
# What is  tortillaland?
tortillaland is a minecraft series made by the popular spanish streamer auronplay on twitch! several famous (and not famous) streamers are invited to this series.
# What is a tortilla?
In Spain a tortilla is a recipe made with eggs mainly and some other ingridients like onions, cheese, meat etc. A tortilla would look like this:

# Why did you made this? 
As i said before i started this project to put in practice what i learned about fastAPI and practice python as well.
# Which tecnologies were used here?
python and the framework fastAPI
# Do you have any plans for this in the future?
Kinda, there is soooo many things that i need to add, like more members, the staff of the game, some cool buildings etc. but because it is just me, i cant watch the amount of streams of each streamer KEKW.
BUT, maybe in my freetimes or if someone else who is also a fan of tortilland wants to get involved or help not necessarely with coding but with some info, i will still working on this :D

# A last few things before you use the API.
1. There still need more info about more players in the series, because it is a series  sometime more people is added, so probably you will miss a few streamers that are currently in the series but not here.
2. There still info about other things related to series but unfortunately, at this time (16/11/2022) i dont know where i can find that info. if i can, will update it as fast as i can!.
3. There could be some mistakes made by me, probably a typo or incorrect information, feel free to notify me or if you want to suggest something feel free to do it!

# Now, how do i use the API itself?
